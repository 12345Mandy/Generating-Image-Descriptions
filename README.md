# Generating Image Descriptions

## Starting Out

You should run commands in the src folder of the project directory.

Note: a pretrained vgg16 is used in the main project. An implementation of vg16 for 10 classes can be run from the root directory (vgg16.py). https://www.kaggle.com/alessiocorrado99/animals10 -> download this dataset and rename folder to vgg16-data before running the file.
